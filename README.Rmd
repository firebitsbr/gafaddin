# gafaddin

GitHub Activity Feed RStudio Addin

## Description

Minimal HTML-view GitHub activity feed viewer.

## What's Inside The Tin

An add-in for RStudio. 

OK, three add-ins. Two for Twitter and one for GH. Use the Twitter ones at your own risk.

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/gafaddin")
```

This uses the `gh` package so you need to have your environment variables in order for
this to work.

It also prefers Fira Sans.

Then go tothe 'Addins' menu and choose it.
